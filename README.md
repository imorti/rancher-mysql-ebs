# rancher-mysql-ebs
A docker-compose file for mysql using a load balancer that also references an ebs volume for storage

# Rancher EBS
For this to work properly, you have to add the Rancher EBS stack from the catalog and configure a volume with the name msql-test. 

I also recommend you have a few hosts configured in your environment.

As always, keep it simple.
